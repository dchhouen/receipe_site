    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Easy-to-make, fluffy, perfectly sweet vegan cornbread made with 10 ingredients. The perfect comforting side to soups and chilis, or to bake into croutons for salads or stuffing.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>flax egg</li>
        <li>unsweetened Plain Almond Milk</li>
        <li>lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>baking soda</li>
        <li>vegan butter,melted</li>
        <li>granulated sugar</li>
        <li>unsweetened applesauce</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>cornmeal</li>
        <li>unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>preheat oven to 350 degree F and grease an 8x8-inch baking dish</li>
        <li>Prepare flax egg in a small bowl and let set for a few minutes to achieve an "eggy" texture. Measure out almond milk, add lemon juice, and let curdle for a few minutes. Then add baking soda and stir once more. Set aside. </li>
        <li>To a large mixing bowl, add melted butter and sugar and whisk vigorously to combine. Then add applesauce and flax egg, and whisk once more. Next add almond milk mixture and whisk vigorously again to combine.</li>
        <li>Add salt, cornmeal, and flour and stir with a spoon until just incorporated. It will look thin and somewhat lumpy. That's what you're going for.</li>
        <li>Add batter to prepared dish(es) and bake for 28-37 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let rest in the baking dish for a few minutes before serving. I highly recommend serving these with just a touch of non-dairy butter and maple syrup or honey if not vegan.</li>
